    "# London bike sharing dataset\n",
    "In this project I look at the historical data for bike sharing in London (Disclamer: 'Powered by TfL Open Data')\n",
    "\n",
    "Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset/data\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this exercise is to practice programming in Python and learn how to create visuals in Tableau. \n",
    "The code and visuals are recreated based on an online tutorial by Mo Chen: https://youtu.be/nl9eZl1IOKI?si=e5rKSHWQKvgNBekr\n",
    "To actually learn something, I tried to emerse myself in the problem data set, discover additional insights, and lastly tried some other visuals too.\n",
    "\n",
    "## There are three steps in this project\n",
    "1. Programmatically gather data\n",
    "2. Explore, assess and manipulate the data using the pandas library in Python\n",
    "3. Create impactful visualisation in Tableau\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the structure of this data?\n",
    "In the table we have hourly dataset from 4 Jan 2015 to 3 Jan 2017. We are provided with the number of new bike shares per hour, and the weather conditions (temperature, temperature 'feels like', humidity, windspeed, etc.) at that hour and day.\n",
    "#### Metadata\n",
    "- \"timestamp\" - timestamp field for grouping the data\n",
    "- \"cnt\" - the count of a new bike shares\n",
    "- \"t1\" - real temperature in C\n",
    "- \"t2\" - temperature in C \"feels like\"\n",
    "- \"hum\" - humidity in percentage\n",
    "- \"wind_speed\" - wind speed in km/h\n",
    "- \"weather_code\" - category of the weather; here comes the description of this field:\n",
    "    - 1 = Clear ; mostly clear but have some values with haze/fog/patches of fog/ fog in vicinity \n",
    "    - 2 = scattered clouds / few clouds \n",
    "    - 3 = Broken clouds \n",
    "    - 4 = Cloudy \n",
    "    - 7 = Rain/ light Rain shower/ Light rain \n",
    "    - 10 = rain with thunderstorm \n",
    "    - 26 = snowfall \n",
    "    - 94 = Freezing Fog\n",
    "- \"is_holiday\" - boolean field - 1 holiday / 0 non holiday\n",
    "- \"is_weekend\" - boolean field - 1 if the day is weekend\n",
    "- \"season\" - category field meteorological seasons: \n",
    "    - 0-spring ; \n",
    "    - 1-summer; \n",
    "    - 2-fall; \n",
